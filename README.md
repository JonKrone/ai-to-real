# ai-to-real

This project was an exploration into building an AI-assisted rapid prototyping and deployment system. The core idea was to support a Claude canvas-like app development workflow but adding on a way to deploy those toy apps with a functioning backend and database. While the initial concept was promising, I decided to archive it as the scope and complexity grew beyond my original vision. The technical challenges, while interesting, diverged from the core skills I wanted to develop.

I've chosen to focus my energy on more focused and exciting projects, particularly Lexa and SkyGuide (a project for a flight management company), which better aligns with my current interests and learning goals.
